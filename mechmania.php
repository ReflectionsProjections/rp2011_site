				<h1>MechMania AI Programming Competition</h1>
				<p>Each year at Reflections|Projections, we host an artificial intelligence programming competition. The winner takes home a cash prize and bragging rights for the next year.</p>
				<p>Teams of students are tasked with the challenge of building an AI around a client library to play a game against the other teams. Up until the competition, the content of the game remains a tightly-held secret. The game's goal is announced Friday night and competitors are given a few hours to understand the content and develop a strategy.</p>
				<p>Starting Saturday morning and ending Sunday morning, competitors must build their AI and test it. All entries are then run in a final tournament to determine the winner.</p>
				<p>The competition also accepts corporate sponsors, who compete in a separate bracket. Just for fun, corporate entries will also be run against student entries throughout the weekend to see who's better.</p>
				<h1>Language Notice</h1>
				<p>Due to complications with the 2010 competition, we are restricting entries to Java this year. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Our decision to support only a single language did not come lightly and was the result of extensive debate and analysis.</p>
