        	<h2>History of Reflections | Projections</h2>
            <p>Sixteen years ago, the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery at the University of Illinois (ACM@UIUC) held its first annual student computing conference. Attended by 150 students from across the midwest and supported by fourteen corporations, it was declared a success.</p>
    		<p>Since its beginning, the conference has grown to include the MechMania programming contest and a job fair. This year, we're proud to welcome you to the 17th annual conference from October 7-9, 2011 at the Urbana-Champaign campus. We expect to have over 700 student attendees and 25 corporate sponsors.</p>
    		<p>ACM could not host Reflections | Projections without the generous support of our sponsors. Their donations fund all the events and help keep student fees low.</p>
